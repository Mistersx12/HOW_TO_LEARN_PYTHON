#This script defines a main function that prints a welcome message to the user.
#The if __name__ == '__main__' block at the bottom of the script is a common pattern in Python that allows the script to be run as a standalone program,
#but also imported and used as a module in other programs.

#To run this script, you can simply use the Python interpreter:

python learn_python.py
